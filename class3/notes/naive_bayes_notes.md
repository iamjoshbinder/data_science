Feature Space - Space for all possible events

Sample Space - Space where all events occur (probability)

oragne box has 6 balls / 5 white, 1 black
Green box 3 balls / 2 black, 1 white


P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B)

black 3, white 3
3 balls in orange box
3 balls in other box

P(A|B)=Probability of EVENT A given B

class C = classification label

.5
3 out of 6 P(A|B)

P(A) 2/3
P(B) 1/3
