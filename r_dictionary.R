## R Function Dictionary
# Use this as a reference for all R methods we use either in class, read about at outside reading, or use in homework.

?read.delim 	# Access a function's help file
??base::delimited	# Search for 'delim' in all help files for functions # in 'base'

help.search("delimited") 	# Search for 'delimited' in all help files
RSiteSearch("parsing text")	# Search for the term 'parsing text' on the R site.

#Logical Operators
#! indicates logical negation (NOT).
# and && indicate logical AND and | and || indicate logical OR. 
#xor indicates elementwise exclusive OR.
# isTRUE(x) is an abbreviation of identical(TRUE, x)

! x
x & y
x && y
x | y
x || y
xor(x, y)
isTRUE(x)

###---------------------------------###

# combine use as c(x, y, z) creates a vector 

c() 


## Reading in things
# these two functions take text data stored in a matrix.
# read.csv is a version of read.table that changes the sep option
# according to standard csv format
read.table()
read.csv()


# source takes in an R script. Great for storing common functions that
# you write for everyday use, or an easy way to quickly grab common libraries
# used over and over again in R.
# arguments are a string with the file location. it operates like bash.
source()

read.delim()	#reads in delimited file
# the default setting for all read.* functions is to convert strings to factor types
#ARGUMENTS/USAGE
stringsAsFactors=FALSE 
#to prevent default conversion of strings into factor types
header = "FALSE" # if there is no header data
sep="\t" #sets TAB as the separator 
na.strings="" #sets empty elements into the data into NA

names()	#sets names of columns if none present by using a vector
#such as:
names(c("height", "weight", "age", "sex"))

#-----------------------------#
#-----------------------------#

# use these two to help get a better idea where you are in your filesystem,
# or to change it.
getwd()
setwd()

## Writing things
# writes a csv file from a data frame
write.csv()

## Looking at data
# checking size. Use length for vectors/arrays and nrow/ncol for data
# frames or matrices
length()
nrow()
ncol()
nchar()


# summary spits out valueable information about whatever you are lookin at
summary()

# if you're looking at a fit or prediction, anova explains the variance.
anova()

# str lets you know what your data types are in a data frame or matrix.
str()

# Other various capture points
mean()
colSums()
rowSumns()
colMeans()
rowMeans()
quantile()
median()

## Changing data
# change a column to a different data type

as.factor()
as.numeric()
as.character()
as.Date()

# Transform data into something new.


# Better than for loops
apply()
*apply() # could be m, t, v, s. Can get complicated!

# Aggregations over data points.
aggregate()

## Functions for Machine Learning
# Keep in mind these are essential starters for machine learning problems
# we have only used them in their simplest forms, and can be incredibly
# powerful tools

# linear models
lm()
update()

# classification problems
knn()
knnImputation()
naiveBayes()

###Functions for Catching errors
tryCatch()

#splits the charachter vector into substrings
strsplit()


do.call()

lapply() #applies a function over all strings in given location of the data 
#list apply arguments are as follows
lapply(data$Column, fun.ction)

#do.call executes a function call over a list 
do.call(fun.ction, li.st)

rbind() # row bind all vectors

transform()

#matches values of two arguments
match()


## Graphing data
# Please refer to the ggplot2 documentation since this gets verbose
# Otherwise, we've used (or I like to use)
ggplot()
geom_point()
geom_smooth()
geom_bar()

aes()
scale_color_brewer()
scale_fill_brewer()
labs()
theme_bw()

# basic plotting
plot()
abline()
