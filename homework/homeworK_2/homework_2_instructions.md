## Homework 2: Data Science III, General Assembly
Expected Work Time: ~6 hours
Due Date: May 29, 2013, before class

There are four articles included to read in this folder. They are all articles on data science application on a variety of topics.

# Reading
I'd like you to read through each one. This can be complicated and may even feel out of reach, but there are strategies to get around this that I will have shown you.

1. Talking to text
2. keep track of what you know and don't know
3. Ask Questions at all levels

# Writing
You will pick one of these articles (one that was most interesting to you) and write what is called a "Journal Review." Journal Reviews generally have the following sections:

Objective/Abstract: What is the paper about, and what was the goal of the paper?
Hypothesis: Where any hypothoses made within the paper before the work began? If so, what was it? What did you think about it?

Methods: What methodologies did the paper use to approach its objective? How well did they work?

Conclusions: Overall assessment of the paper. This is generally broken into parts of what you thought about the material you read, do you think it was well written or poorly written, how well did it answer the questions it was looking at, and did you have any follow up questions about the data, methodologies, etc.
